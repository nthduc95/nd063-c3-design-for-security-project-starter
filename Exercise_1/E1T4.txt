Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
Web Services EC2 instance in a public subnet so it can communicate with any endpoint on the internet. It must be on a private subnet, allowing communication on port 5000 only from the Application Load Balancer.

# Poor practice 2
IAM Permissions for EC2 Instances, InstanceRole has full access to any s3 bucket instance 
- allowing all actions (s3:*) 
- all S3 resources (Resource: '*'). 
A violation of the least privilege principle for InstanceRole aws s3 would be granting the role more permissions than it needs to perform its tasks. 
For example, if the role only needs to read from a specific S3 bucket, but it is granted full access to all S3 buckets, that would be a violation of the least privilege principle.
This could expose the role to unnecessary risks, such as data loss, data leakage, or unauthorized access.
It should limit the permissions of the role to the minimum required for its function.
