# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
- Enforce MFA for SSH access. This adds an additional layer of security beyond just the password/SSH key.
- Modify security groups to allow SSH access only from known, trusted IP addresses or networks.
- Allow SSH only for users with specific roles or using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager for secure remote access to instances.


# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
To prevent access to sensitive data in AWS, even if instance API credentials are compromised, you can implement the following measures:
- Use IAM Roles for EC2 Instances: Instead of storing API credentials on instances, use IAM roles.IAM roles provide temporary credentials that are automatically rotated and are more secure.
- Enable Encryption: Encrypt the S3 bucket containing sensitive data using AWS Key Management Service (KMS).This ensures that even if credentials are compromised, the data cannot be accessed without the decryption keys.
- Implement Least Privilege Access: Apply fine-grained permissions to control which operations can be performed by the IAM role associated with the EC2 instance.This limits the actions that can be taken if credentials are compromised.
